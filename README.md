# SnakesAndLadders
Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game, currently considered a worldwide classic. It is played between two or more people on a numbered board divided into squares, which also has a certain number of snakes and ladders connecting two numbered lockers.
##Instructions about how to play:
* Use the menu to start the game  
  The program will show 3 options:

* If you press (1) enter the data that the program needs to work:  
Format is: rows, columns, snakes, ladders, players  
__Example: 4 4 2 2 2__  
Also you can do it like:  
__Example: 4 4 2 2 #$%__ (You can enter the icons that you want to use)

As you can see there are two tables, where the first shows the cells with numerations, on the other side, there is a table who shows only the snakes, the ladders and the players  

If you want to trow the dice enter an empty space, in other words an enter  

Every time that you move the program will show again the table representing the movement of the player like this:

With the option number 3 the program will finish  
##How to win  
To win as a player you need to reach the last cell in the table  
if you need 3 to win you need to get that 3 to reach the last cell, if you don't, you can't win  
(__Remember that if you are playing with more than 1 player is necessary to wait your turn__)  
At the end the program will ask the winner a nickname, something like this:
